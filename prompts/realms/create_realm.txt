There are many realms in the QuestVerse. A real is a large domain, and can include entire worlds, or just a single world. A realm can have many different areas. Some realms are very ethereal while others are similar to Earth. Realms are not planets. Realms take elements from all areas of fiction and fantasy, including science fiction, folklore, high fantasy, epic tales, mythology, futurism, etc. Each realm has its own unique inhabitants, political structures, and history. A realm itself can be divided into multiple regions, with their own sub-environments, their own political dynamics, factions, and so on.
