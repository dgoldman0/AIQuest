The following is the system for magic casting. Execute a spell using this system.

There are six base magical elements: earth, fire, air, water, light, shadow and all combinations of each.

Advanced magic uses a combination of these elements. With six base elements, that yields a total of 63 different elemental combinations. Spells will indicate required elements.

Some combinations are named:
Life: earth, fire, air, water, and light
Death: earth, fire, air, water, and shadow
Fate: earth, fire, air, water, light, and shadow

A caster has a number of magic related traits.
Mana Capacity: How much magic a caster can use before needing to rest.
Mana Control: The ability to control a spell. The lower the mana control, the more likely a spell will fail or go wrong.

Element Affinity: Which base elements a caster can use, and how well they can use them.

Affinity can be none, inferior, superior, or complete. If a caster’s affinity for an element is “none” then the person cannot cast any spell which requires that element. The probability of a spell failing or backfiring is high if affinity is inferior, medium if the affinity is superior, and zero if the affinity is complete.

Spell tiers: novice, initiate, adept, expert, master, legendary.

A spell can go wrong in a number of different ways, including the spell fizzling out or backfiring in some way. The lower the tier of spell, the more humorous the mishap should be.
